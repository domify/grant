# Grant for ris

An Active Record ORM for ris, grown from Grant (0.23.4, commit `625ccd7`) for Crystal. It is not a
1:1 port: reads move onto the ris tape, so the shape differs from Crystal Grant while the public
API stays as close to it as the tape allows. The Crystal sources live in `crystal-upstream/` as
reference.

**Status: work in progress, not released.** Expect breaking changes. SQLite and PostgreSQL are in
scope; MySQL is not.

## Progress (2026-10-17)

Upstream specs are translated near line by line, keeping every assertion. Each test runs against
both SQLite and PostgreSQL 17.

| Area         | Spec files | Examples    |
|--------------|-----------:|------------:|
| transactions |    45 / 53 |   429 / 496 |
| query        |   57 / 225 |  453 / 2564 |
| other        |    35 / 65 |   100 / 276 |
| associations |    9 / 109 |   70 / 1121 |
| dirty_state  |     2 / 27 |    14 / 279 |
| **total**    |  148 / 479 | 1066 / 4736 |

About 22% of the upstream examples are ported. The transaction and connection core is nearly
complete, and schema migrations (DDL, renames, references, reversible migrations, verification)
are largely done; associations, dirty tracking and most of the query surface are still to do.

## What you can use today

These parts are ported, tested on SQLite and PostgreSQL, and reasonably usable from an application:

- **Models**: `class User < Base`, `table`, `connection`, `column` (including custom primary keys
  and natural keys), timestamps, defaults, `to_h`, JSON/YAML serialization.
- **Persistence**: `create`, `save`, `update`, `destroy`, `touch`, `import_records` (bulk insert),
  `find` / `find_strict`, `reload`, read-only records.
- **Callbacks**: lifecycle callbacks (`before_*`, `after_*`, `around_*`), aborting via callbacks,
  `after_commit` / `after_rollback` with `on:` options and savepoint de-duplication.
- **Transactions**: nested transactions, savepoints (`requires_new`), joinable transactions,
  isolation levels, read-only transactions, `Rollback` as an error value, manual transaction
  handles, cross-database nesting, transaction notifications/events.
- **Locking**: pessimistic locking (`lock`, `with_lock`).
- **Queries**: `where` (hash, raw SQL, operators), `order`, `limit`, `offset`, `distinct`, `joins`,
  `group_records`, `having`, `first`/`last`/`take`, `all`, `count`, `exists?`, `pluck`, `pick`,
  `ids`, `update_all`, `delete_all`, default scopes, `unscoped`, `scoping`.
- **Connections**: connection registry, pools, `with_connection`, reconnect on idle/broken
  connections, reader/writer roles with replica routing, fiber-local connection context.
- **Errors**: upstream error taxonomy; driver errors are translated into `StatementInvalid`,
  `RecordNotUnique`, `NotNullViolation`, `InvalidForeignKey`, `Deadlocked`, `LockWaitTimeout` etc.
- **Encryption**: `encrypts` with AES-256-CBC + HMAC, deterministic and randomized modes, lazy
  decryption, `without_encryption`.
- **Schema**: `Model.migrator` for `create`, `drop` and `drop_and_create` of model tables.

Not usable yet: associations (`has_many`, `belongs_to`, `has_one`, polymorphic, eager loading),
dirty tracking API, most validations, sharding, counter caches, enum attributes, nested
attributes, query cache, MySQL.

## Example

Add Grant to your project's `ris.mod`:

```
require github.com/domify/grant v0.0.0 as grant
```

The modules live under `grant/` inside the package, so an import names the
package's short name and then that directory:

```ris
import grant/grant/base::{Base}
import grant/grant/connections::{Connections}
import grant/grant/adapter/sqlite::{Sqlite}

class User < Base
  table users
  connection sqlite
  column id : Int64, primary: true
  column name : String
end

Connections.register("sqlite", Sqlite.new("sqlite", "sqlite3:./app.db"))
User.migrator.drop_and_create.or_panic

user = User.create(name: "Ann")
user.name = "Anna"
user.save
found = User.find_strict(user.id).or_panic
users = User.where(name: "Anna").order(:id).select.or_panic
user.destroy
```

For PostgreSQL use `grant/grant/adapter/pg::{Pg}` with a `postgres://user:pass@host:port/db` URL.

## Differences from Crystal Grant

ris has no exceptions and no `!` at the end of names, so (see [doc/NAMING.md](doc/NAMING.md)):

- `raise` becomes a returned error value (types implement `Error`); handle it with a union check,
  propagate it with postfix `!`, or unwrap with `.or_panic`.
- Raising variants `find!`, `save!`, `create!`, ... are `find_strict`, `save_strict`,
  `create_strict`, ...
- In-place relation mutators `where!`, `order!`, ... are `where_in_place`, `order_in_place`, ...
- Keyword clashes get aliases: `import` → `import_records`, `group` → `group_records`,
  `and`/`or` → `and_where`/`or_where`.
- A transaction rolls back when its block returns an error.

## Running the tests

Requires the ris compiler and, for PostgreSQL, a local server
(`docker start grant-pg`, postgres:17 on `127.0.0.1:5433`, user `grant` / `password`).

```sh
export IYI_CACHE_DIR=$PWD/.ris-cache
bin/test                                # all tests, SQLite and PostgreSQL
TEST_ADAPTERS=sqlite bin/test           # SQLite only
bin/test test/grant_transaction_test.ri # selected tests
ris test test/delete_test.ri            # one test by hand, SQLite
```

Tests live in `test/` and run from the repository root. ris resolves imports from the
entry file's directory, so each test starts with a `module test/<name>` header that anchors
its imports at the root, and declares its models `pub` so Grant's macros can reach them.

## License

MIT, same as upstream Grant. See [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Database dependencies

Grant uses the common types from `github.com/domify/db` and the drivers `github.com/domify/sqlite`
and `github.com/domify/pg`. Until their ris versions are tagged, `ris.mod` replaces them with
sibling checkouts (`../db`, `../sqlite`, `../pg`).

Grant keeps a compatibility facade for its observers, transaction materialization, SQL conventions
and public errors. Database connections, statement ownership, parameter binding and row decoding
belong to the drivers. Replacements inside dependencies do not apply, so a project using Grant
needs the same `replace` lines for now.

Keep sources and logs outside `.ris-cache`, which the compiler prunes.
